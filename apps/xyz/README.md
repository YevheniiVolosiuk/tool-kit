# ğŸš€ Kit - Laravel Template ğŸš€

This is a pretty simplified, but complete, workflow for starting a Laravel Application. The included docker-compose.yml file, Dockerfiles, and config files, set up a LEMP stack powering a Laravel application in the `code` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> This template is to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/rcravens/kit">kit</a> project.
